  <h1>The Track and Grounds</h1>

  <ul class="track-description">
    <li>
      <strong>Generally</strong>
      <p>
        One-half acre of fully fenced (6' wooden privacy), manicured play area for our furry friends located in SW Palm Bay.
        The grounds are flowing with beautiful tropical plants and shade, including a shaded staging area to observe the hounds, and water and cooling areas.
        Park in the driveway indicated and enter through the gate into the play area, once a play date has been arranged.

      <strong>The Pack Area</strong>
      <p>There are two different areas for sighthound mixing and making friends.</p>

      <strong>The Routes</strong>
      <p>
        We have identified three natural routes greyhounds take during zoomies, and covered their entirety with manicured grass or Playsafe mulchâ€”the kind used specifically under children's playground equipment.
